# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A ride-sharing company, PyBer Ride-Share, has provided it servies to various cities and wants to improve their services in underserved neighborhood and determine the affordability if this improvement. The CEO wants to see a series of visualization demostrating the following base on city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban):
* Percentage:
  - Total Rides
  - Total Drivers
  - Total Fares
* Average Fare per City
* Average Fare per Driver
* Average Fare vs Total Numbers of Rides
## Results 
Riders that reside rural cities and neighborhoods rather than Suburban, have 3.5 times lower rides on average, 4 times less drivers, and ride cost are about $5 more in comparsion. In contrast Urban cities and neighborhoods have 9 times more average drivers active, 4 times more rides in the week span given, and about $11 less than the average ride in rural areas. 

From the graphs you can see a trend where the closer you are to an Urban city or neighborhood there are more drivers servicing the areas, more rides occuring, and the average fare are lower. Which puts the Rural and Suburban cities and neighborhoods in the underserved catogory.

### Box-and-Whisker Plots of Driver Count, Ride Count, and Ride Fare Data points
Using box-whisker plot graph to discover any outliers in the data to aid the analysis and also clean the data. During the process an outlier was found among the Ride count data, the highest ride count was in West Angela which is an Urban city.

### Weelky Average Fare, Total Fare, Ride Count by City Type
Total Fare and Ride Count are similar with but not exactly the same, for every ride there will be a fare amount and depending on the distances of the ride. The urban city type is the most profitable because the demand and supply are fairly equal, but the rural city type could have an unforeseen demand and because there aren't a high number of drivers available.

## Summary
Compiling the imformation from the graphs, the urban cities and neighborhoods experience the highest riders, drivers, and the losest fare amount than rural and suburban areas. There are a few recommendations to overcome the shortage of drivers in rural and suburban areas, 
  - Provide an incentive for drivers to travel or provide services to the underserved areas.
  - One possibilty is that the residents in the rural and suburban areas might not know of the ride-share services you provdie, on thing to consider is the level of advertising in the area to make sure the customers are aware of the company.
  - Possibily Survey the current customers in the urban and suburban cities and neighborhoods and gauge demand of service, what keeps the riders coming back, and some imporvement. Use this information to advocate to the rural cities and neighborhoods as a way to advertise services.
  - Possibily making it cheaper for a period of time in the rural and suburban areas with the least amount of rides, confirm a certain number of drivers will be in the area, and see in the span of time does the demand for rides go up in those areas to cerify that if funding is put aside for the expansion or imporvement that it would be a deficit.
